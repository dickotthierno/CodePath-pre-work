## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [W3schools]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [One of the challenge I encountered in creating this submission was how to understand the general structure of the javascript code for making the game work. But with a lot of time spent on it and the review of some javascripts lessons on W3school I was able to understand the phenomen. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [The question I have after completing this assignment is about the main goal of this game, what users achieve from it? Is it something related to reduce stress or anxiety ? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would like to change little bit on the button disign by making them a circle instead of square and also adding one more button in the middle which would be equidistant to the side four bottom.]
